            Hello, my name is Trevor Eckberg and welcome to my portfolio page. I
            am a current student at the University of Washington pursuing a
            certificate in Software Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been working with HTML and CSS for the last 10 years, and
            began working with Wordpress 5 years ago. I am currently developing
            my skills in Javascript and will soon expand to other Back-End
            languages.
